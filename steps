  In case you run into the following error when build your first Jenkins job

FATAL: Couldn't find any executable in /Users/xxxxx/Documents/apache-maven-3.3.9
Build step 'Invoke top-level Maven targets' marked build as failure
Finished: FAILURE
it means jenkins  user doesn't have permissions to access your maven directory. (Jenkins by default will run all builds under a special user name called jenkins )



Solution:

To fix it, we need to ensure that jenkins user has read and executable permission on /**/**apache-maven-**  folder.

When faced with issue on 404 or filenot found exception

I installed the tomcat 8.5.35 remotely on other machine. I did the following steps to solve this problem:

1. Change $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml (Same as the course)

  <role rolename="manager-script"/>

  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>

  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>

  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-script,admin-gui,manager-gui"/>



2. Because the default version come with Catalina directory, I put another file in the $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost folder, named manager.xml, in which the content is:



<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<Context privileged="true" antiResourceLocking="false"   

         docBase="${catalina.home}/webapps/manager"> 

             <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="^.*$" /> 

</Context>



3. Save and restart and profit.
